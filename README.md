# Melody Generator

## Overview

The Melody Generator is a Python program that uses deep learning techniques to generate musical melodies. It can create melodies using a variety of algorithms and is designed to provide flexibility for experimenting with different musical styles and parameters.

## Features

- **Random Melody Generation:** The program can generate random melodies based on user-defined parameters, such as key, scale, and length.

- **Algorithmic Composition:** It employs algorithms like Markov Chains and LSTM networks for creating melodies with specific patterns and styles.

- **MIDI Export:** Melodies generated by the program can be exported as MIDI files for use in digital audio workstations (DAWs) and other music software.

- **Customization:** Users can specify musical parameters, including tempo, time signature, and instrument choice.
